**Analysis**

- Systematically processed raw Melbourne housing data from the years 2016 to 2018 across various suburbs, enhancing its usability for in-depth analysis. The data transformation was executed within SQL Server, ensuring the data is optimally structured for comprehensive insights.
- Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and communicate key findings from the analysis.

**Key Insights:**
- Identified that East Melbourne has the highest-priced houses compared to the rest of Melbourne.
- Discovered that the distance to the central business district (CBD) does not solely determine house prices. Suburbs like Brighton, far from the main CBD, have higher median prices than Altona North, which is much closer.
- Highlighted that the number of rooms in a house is not always indicative of higher prices, contrary to common assumptions.
- Found that Melbourne's east is more developed, greener, and home to good schools, creating higher demand compared to supply, contributing to higher house prices.
- Noted the presence of some of the city's oldest apartments in Melbourne's east, including stunning Art Deco designs and grand Victorian terraces.
